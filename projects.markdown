## 🌱 Crop Yield Prediction and Plant Disease Detection

Developed a system for crop prediction using IoT and machine learning, significantly enhancing the precision and effectiveness of agricultural practices. By utilizing a decision tree algorithm, the system analyzes real-time sensor data to predict which crop will yield the best results based on factors such as soil type, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. This approach ensures that farmers can select the most suitable crops for their specific environmental conditions, thereby maximizing yield potential and optimizing resource usage.

For plant disease detection, the system employs image processing technology to identify potential diseases early. Implemented logistic regression and K-Means clustering models to refine the accuracy of disease detection. The logistic regression model classifies the likelihood of disease presence based on various environmental factors, while the K-Means model clusters similar data points to identify patterns and anomalies in crop health. This dual-model approach not only improves the reliability of predictions but also provides actionable insights that help farmers make informed decisions, ultimately enhancing overall agricultural productivity by reducing crop losses and optimizing resource usage.

## 📝 Document Controller for Construction Field
I developed a comprehensive software solution for managing construction-related documents using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This software significantly reduced manual labor by automating the document management process, allowing for more efficient handling of project documentation. 

By streamlining the storage and retrieval processes, I enhanced overall project management efficiency. The system I created enabled easy access to important documents and ensured that all project stakeholders could quickly find the information they needed. This innovation not only saved time but also minimized errors associated with manual document handling, leading to smoother project workflows and better resource management.

## 📊 Supermarket Management System
I developed a Supermarket Management System to streamline sales and purchase data management. This system featured bill generation and a user-friendly interface, making daily operations smoother and more efficient. To tackle inventory issues, I used machine learning algorithms to analyze sales trends and predict inventory needs. This helped prevent stockouts and overstock situations, ensuring the supermarket always had the right amount of stock.

Additionally, I added features to track inventory in real-time and generate detailed sales reports. These reports provided valuable insights into sales performance, customer buying habits, and inventory turnover rates. By using this data, the supermarket could make better decisions about restocking, promotions, and overall business strategy. The system not only improved operational efficiency but also supported strategic planning and enhanced customer satisfaction.
