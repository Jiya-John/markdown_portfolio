# Hi, I'm Jiya John

Welcome to my digital portfolio!   

Driven by curiosity and a love for technology, I explore the frontiers of AI, Machine Learning, and web development to create impactful solutions. 

Currently studying Web development at [Humber College](https://humber.ca/), I‚Äôve completed AI-ML course, with advanced AI/ML projects and bring hands-on experience from my role as an Information Security Manager at TCS, where I led MEA-region data security initiatives and trained associates on cyber threat prevention.
With a foundation in Computer Science Engineering, I‚Äôve built intelligent systems and responsive web interfaces. I thrive in dynamic environments, collaborating on research and staying active in tech communities.
